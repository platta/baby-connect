# Introduction

Thank you for considering making a contribution to my repository. I'm not the
most experienced GitHub user or contributor myself, so I've assembled these
guidelines to help make this a pleasant experience for all of us!

Please review the guidelines and make an effort to follow them. I understand
that nobody's perfect (neither am I!) so as long as you make an honest effort
I'm happy to meet you halfway.

Some examples of the types of contributions I would most welcome are:

- Making existing functionality more robust or flexible.
- Well reasoned improvements in code organization and folder structure (i.e.
  link me to documentation showing why your suggested change is a best
  practice).
- Reporting issues for bugs in the code.
- Additional error handling.
- Unit tests.
- Small, even pedantic corrections of spelling, grammar, or spacing.

Contributions I will entertain, but may not accept are:

- Adding new functionality. This will all depend on whether or not it fits with
  my vision for the repo. If it turns out that our visions are too different,
  you can always fork the repo!

Please do not use the issue tracker to ask general questions or request help,
you can always reach me on Twitter at [@platta](https://twitter.com/platta), or
drop me an e-mail at [adam@plattsoft.net](mailto:adam@plattsoft.net).

# Ground Rules

- Be respectful in all communications (that includes comments in your code).
- Match your coding style to the existing code.
- Use meaningful function and variable names.
- Comment often in your code, but avoid redundant or unnecessary comments.
- Do not combine multiple changes into a single commit.
- Include messages in your commits.
    - First line should be a summary of the change, under 50 characters
      preferably.
    - Underneath the first line, include details of the change and the reasons
      why it was made.

# How to report a bug

First and foremost, if the issue you're reporting is a security vulnerability,
__DO NOT__ open an issue. E-mail me at
[adam@plattsoft.net](mailto:adam@plattsoft.net) so that nobody can exploit the
vulnerability and take advantage of anyone currently using this code.

If you're not sure whether or not your issue is a security vulnerability,
consider these questions:

- Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access
  to?
- Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions is "yes", then you're probably
dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both
questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure,
just email me.

For non-security related issues, feel free to open an issue in the GitHub issue
tracker. Please try to be as specific as possible and include as much
information as you can.

Again, please do not use the issue tracker for general questions or to ask for
help. Contact me via Twitter or E-mail for that. 

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

The best way to build a new feature is to start at the highest level, and that's
why I like to start by understanding the need that exists and how it will be
satisfied by a new feature. Quite often, the first idea we have for satisfying
a need is not the most efficient one. Starting from the beginning and having a
little discussion can help us get to a better implementation!

- Open an issue to describe your suggestion.
- Clearly state that you are suggesting a new feature, not reporting a bug.
- Describe, step by step, the use case you see that makes the new feature
  useful or necessary.
- Detail the need that your use case creates.
- Describe the new feature in as much detail as possible.
- Explain how the new feature meeds the need you've described.
